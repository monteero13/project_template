	abstract = "{Wilms' tumor gene WT1 encodes a transcription factor and plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation. The WT1 gene is highly expressed in leukemia and various types of solid tumors, whereas WT1 is a tumor marker convenient for the detection of minimal residual disease of leukemia. The WT1 gene was originally defined as a tumor suppressor gene, but we proposed that it was, on the contrary, an oncogene. Furthermore, the WT1 protein has proven to be a promising tumor-associated antigen, in which many human leukocyte antigen class I- or II-restricted WT1 epitopes have been identified. Clinical trials of WT1-targeted immunotherapy have confirmed its safety and clinical efficacy. WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and WT1 antibodies are spontaneously induced in tumor-bearing patients, probably because of high immunogenicity of the WT1 protein. WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes make a major contribution to the graft-versus-leukemia effect after allogenic stem cell transplantation. When 75 cancer antigens including WT1 were prioritized according to several criteria such as therapeutic function and immunogenicity, WT1 was ranked as the top antigen. These findings suggest that a new era of WT1 immunotherapy is imminent.}",

	abstract = {The Wilms' tumor 1 gene (WT1) has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene involved in the etiology of Wilms' tumor. Approximately 10% of all Wilms' tumors carry mutations in the WT1 gene. Alterations in the WT1 gene have also been observed in other tumor types, such as leukemia, mesothelioma and desmoplastic small round cell tumor. Dependent on the tumor type, WT1 proteins might either function as tumor suppressor proteins or as survival factors. Mutations in the WT1 gene can also result in congenital abnormalities as observed in Denys–Drash and Frasier syndrome patients. Mouse models have proven the critical importance of WT1 expression for the development of several organs, including the kidneys, the gonads and the spleen. The WT1 proteins seem to perform two main functions. They regulate the transcription of a variety of target genes and may be involved in post-transcriptional processing of RNA. The WT1 gene encodes at least 24 protein forms. These isoforms have partially distinct biological functions and effects, which in many cases are also specific for the model system in which WT1 is studied. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms by which the various WT1 isoforms exert their functions in normal development and how alterations in WT1 may lead to developmental abnormalities and tumor growth.}

    abstract = "{The PITX2 (paired-like homeodomain 2) gene encodes a bicoid-like homeodomain transcription factor linked with several human disorders. The main associated congenital phenotype is Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, type 1, an autosomal dominant condition characterized by variable defects in the anterior segment of the eye, an increased risk of glaucoma, craniofacial dysmorphism and dental and umbilical anomalies; in addition to this, one report implicated PITX2 in ring dermoid of the cornea and a few others described cardiac phenotypes. We report three novel PITX2 mutations—c.271C \&gt; T, p.(Arg91Trp); c.259T \&gt; C, p.(Phe87Leu); and c.356delA, p.(Gln119Argfs*36)—identified in independent families with typical Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome characteristics and some unusual features such as corneal guttata, Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, and hyperextensibility. To gain further insight into the diverse roles of PITX2/pitx2 in vertebrate development, we generated various genetic lesions in the pitx2 gene via TALEN-mediated genome editing. Affected homozygous zebrafish demonstrated congenital defects consistent with the range of PITX2-associated human phenotypes: abnormal development of the cornea, iris and iridocorneal angle; corneal dermoids; and craniofacial dysmorphism. In addition, via comparison of pitx2M64* and wild-type embryonic ocular transcriptomes we defined molecular changes associated with pitx2 deficiency, thereby implicating processes potentially underlying disease pathology. This analysis identified numerous affected factors including several members of the Wnt pathway and collagen types I and V gene families. These data further support the link between PITX2 and the WNT pathway and suggest a new role in regulation of collagen gene expression during development.}",

   abstract = {Congenital aniridia is a rare genetic eye disorder with total or partial absence of the iris from birth. In most cases the genetic origin of aniridia is a mutation in the PAX6 gene, leading to involvement of most eye structures. Hypoplasia of the fovea is usually present and is associated with reduced visual acuity and nystagmus. Aniridia-associated keratopathy, glaucoma, and cataract are serious and progressive complications that can further reduce visual function. Treatment of the ocular complications of aniridia is challenging and has a high risk of side effects. New approaches such as stem cell therapy may, however, offer better prognoses. We describe the various ocular manifestations of aniridia, with a special focus on conditions that commonly require treatment. We also review the growing literature reporting systemic manifestations of the disease.},

   abstract = {Congenital aniridia is a rare, panocular disorder with a main phenotypic characteristic of a partial or complete absence of the iris existing alongside other ocular morbidities such as cataract, keratopathy, optic nerve and foveal hypoplasia, and nystagmus. The iris abnormality, however, often leads to symptoms such as photophobia, glare, and decreased visual acuity, as well as cosmetic dissatisfaction. Current management options for the iris deficit include colored iris contact lenses, corneal tattooing, and tinted contact lenses. Symptoms arising from small iris defects can be resolved with surgical management using micro-tying suture techniques such as McCannel or Siepser. Currently, larger iris defects can be treated with artificial iris implants. New prosthetic options range from colored intraocular lenses to flexible custom-made silicone iris implants. With a range of therapeutic options available and given the challenges of multiple comorbidities in aniridia, we evaluate the literature relating to the use of artificial iris implants in congenital aniridia, with a focus on the different surgical implantation techniques, the clinical outcomes achieved, complications occurred, and risk of bias of the studies included.},
