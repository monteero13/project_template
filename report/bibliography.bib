	abstract = "{Wilms' tumor gene WT1 encodes a transcription factor and plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation. The WT1 gene is highly expressed in leukemia and various types of solid tumors, whereas WT1 is a tumor marker convenient for the detection of minimal residual disease of leukemia. The WT1 gene was originally defined as a tumor suppressor gene, but we proposed that it was, on the contrary, an oncogene. Furthermore, the WT1 protein has proven to be a promising tumor-associated antigen, in which many human leukocyte antigen class I- or II-restricted WT1 epitopes have been identified. Clinical trials of WT1-targeted immunotherapy have confirmed its safety and clinical efficacy. WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and WT1 antibodies are spontaneously induced in tumor-bearing patients, probably because of high immunogenicity of the WT1 protein. WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes make a major contribution to the graft-versus-leukemia effect after allogenic stem cell transplantation. When 75 cancer antigens including WT1 were prioritized according to several criteria such as therapeutic function and immunogenicity, WT1 was ranked as the top antigen. These findings suggest that a new era of WT1 immunotherapy is imminent.}",

	abstract = {The Wilms' tumor 1 gene (WT1) has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene involved in the etiology of Wilms' tumor. Approximately 10% of all Wilms' tumors carry mutations in the WT1 gene. Alterations in the WT1 gene have also been observed in other tumor types, such as leukemia, mesothelioma and desmoplastic small round cell tumor. Dependent on the tumor type, WT1 proteins might either function as tumor suppressor proteins or as survival factors. Mutations in the WT1 gene can also result in congenital abnormalities as observed in Denysâ€“Drash and Frasier syndrome patients. Mouse models have proven the critical importance of WT1 expression for the development of several organs, including the kidneys, the gonads and the spleen. The WT1 proteins seem to perform two main functions. They regulate the transcription of a variety of target genes and may be involved in post-transcriptional processing of RNA. The WT1 gene encodes at least 24 protein forms. These isoforms have partially distinct biological functions and effects, which in many cases are also specific for the model system in which WT1 is studied. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms by which the various WT1 isoforms exert their functions in normal development and how alterations in WT1 may lead to developmental abnormalities and tumor growth.}
